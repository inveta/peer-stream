# UE5 Pixel Streaming SDK [中文](README-zh.md) [English](README.md)

Compared to EpicGame's heavily-designed SDK for Pixel Streaming, peer-stream.js is a lightweight WebRTC library with 0 dependency, containing a frontend component (using WebComponents API), along with a signaling server (using NodeJS).

- peer-stream.js: browser SDK for player
- signal.js: node.js signaling server
- signal.json: configure signal.js
- signal.html: GUI for signal.js and example for peer-stream.js

## Demo

```s
# install WebSocket
npm install ws@8.5.0

# start Signaling Server
node signal.js

# start packaged UE5
start path/to/UE5.exe -PixelStreamingURL="ws://localhost:88"

# visit webpage
start http://localhost:88/signal.html
```

## signal.json

| env           | type     | default | usage                                                               |
| ------------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PORT          | number   | 88      | WebSocket/HTTP port for player & UE5                                |
| UE5           | string[] | []      | run command when player connected (UE5 auto start)                  |
| one2one       | bool     | false   | one-to-one mapping for player & UE5                                 |
| auth          | string   | ''      | HTTP Basic Auth username:password                                   |
| boot          | bool     | false   | node signal.js on system boot                                       |
| exeUeCoolTime | number   | 60      | Time interval between starting the same UE instance again next time |
| preload       | number   | 1       | Number of pre started UE instances                                  |

### Load Balance

`signal.js` accept multi UE5 & player connections, where each UE5 maps to multi-players with load-balancing. Turn `one2one` on to keep one-to-one mapping. Provide `UE5` to start UE5 automatically. All configs in `signal.json`.

## Unreal Engine

enable the plugin:

```s
Plugins > Built-In > Graphics > Pixel Streaming > Enabled
Editor Preferences > Level Editor > Play > Additional Launch Parameters
start path/to/UE5.exe -{key}={value}
```

common startup options:

```s
 -PixelStreamingURL="ws://localhost:88"
 -RenderOffScreen
 -Unattended
 -GraphicsAdapter=0
 -ForceRes
 -ResX=1280
 -ResY=720
 -PixelStreamingWebRTCFps=30
 -Windowed
 -AudioMixer
 -AllowPixelStreamingCommands
 -PixelStreamingEncoderRateControl=VBR
```

## peer-stream.js

HTML:

```html
<script src="//localhost:88/peer-stream.js"></script>
<video is="peer-stream" id="ws://127.0.0.1:88/"></video>
```

or JavaScript:

```html
<script type="module">
import "//localhost:88/peer-stream.js";
const ps = document.createElement("video", { is: "peer-stream" });
ps.id = "ws://127.0.0.1:88/";
document.body.append(ps);
</script>
```

### Messages

sending messages:

```js
// object will be JSON.stringify()
ps.emitMessage(msg: string | object);
```

receiving messages:

```js
ps.addEventListener("message", e => {
    // JSON.parse(e.detail)
});
```
